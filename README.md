# NumericalCalculator
Numerical Calculator in .NET C#

Main advantage of this program is that you can input complex formulas "as is". No need pressing buttons with functions or numbers. Just write it. 

It uses numerical libraries from this repo: https://github.com/Rychu-Pawel/NumericalLibraries

You can download installable version from here: http://pawelrychlicki.pl/Application/Details/6/numerical-calculator-14

This project was one of two main parts of my master's thesis. Second one were the libraries mentioned above.
